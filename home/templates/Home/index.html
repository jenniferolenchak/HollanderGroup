	<h2>Our Vision</h2>
	<p1>
		Savester is a web application for anyone with consistent income looking to better manage their money. Users can
		easily keep track of their reoccurring income and expenses to view a weekly, biweekly, and monthly budget
		regardless of payment frequency. At its core, Savester is a budgeting web application that compiles data to
		provide users with numeric and graphic breakdowns. Because of this functionality, the app is able to promote
		positive saving habits by providing users a budget, expense report, visual savings goal, and recommendations
		based on user input. Unlike other applications, Savester doesn't request that users connect any confidential
		information to their profile, such as bank account credentials or credit/debit card information. Savester works
		with only the data users are comfortable sharing, and allows them to start saving immediately.
