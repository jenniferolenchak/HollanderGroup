	<h2>Our Vision</h2>
	<p1>
		Savester is a web application for anyone with consistent income looking to better manage their money. Users can easily keep track of their reoccurring income and expenses to view a weekly, biweekly, and monthly budget regardless of payment frequency. At its core, Savester is a budgeting web application that compiles data to provide users with numeric and graphic breakdowns. Because of this functionality, the app is able to promote positive saving habits by providing users a budget, expense report, visual savings goal, and recommendations based on user input. Unlike other applications, Savester doesn't request that users connect any confidential information to their profile, such as bank account credentials or credit/debit card information. Savester works with only the data users are comfortable sharing, and allows them to start saving immediately.
